# Tableau Analysis

## Objective
The objective of the Tableau analysis is to visualize and communicate key healthcare cost drivers identified through Excel and SQL analysis. Interactive dashboards were created to highlight cost differences across demographic and behavioral segments.

## Dataset Used
The Tableau dashboard uses the cleaned and transformed healthcare dataset, including the following key fields:
- Age Group
- BMI Category
- Smoking Status
- Healthcare Charges

The data source aligns with the validated outputs from Excel Power Query and SQL aggregations.

## Dashboards & Worksheets Created
The Tableau workbook includes the following visual components:
- Average Healthcare Cost by Smoking Status
- Average Healthcare Cost by BMI Category
- Average Healthcare Cost by Age Group

These views are combined into a single dashboard to enable comparative analysis.

## Design Approach
- Bar charts were used to compare average costs across categories
- Consistent color schemes were applied for clarity
- Filters were added to improve interactivity and usability
- The dashboard layout was optimized for executive-level insights

## Key Insights
- Smoking status is the strongest driver of healthcare costs
- Obese and overweight BMI categories show higher average charges
- Healthcare costs increase significantly with higher age groups
