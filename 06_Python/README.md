# Python Analysis

## Objective
The objective of the Python analysis is to validate and reproduce healthcare cost insights using programmatic data analysis. Python is used to confirm calculations performed in Excel and SQL and to create supporting visualizations.

## Dataset Used
- Cleaned healthcare dataset (CSV format)
- Source aligned with Excel Power Query output

Key columns used:
- Age Group
- BMI Category
- Smoking Status
- Charges

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Analysis Performed
The following validations were performed using Python:
- Average healthcare cost by smoking status
- Average healthcare cost by BMI category
- Average healthcare cost by age group

These calculations were compared against Excel and SQL results to ensure consistency.

## Visualizations
- Bar chart showing average healthcare cost by smoking status
- Visual confirmation of key cost drivers

## Validation
All Python results matched outputs from Excel, SQL, and Tableau, confirming data accuracy and analytical consistency.
