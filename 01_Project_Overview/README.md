# Project Overview

## Project Title
Healthcare Cost Drivers Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to identify and analyze the key drivers influencing healthcare insurance costs using an end-to-end analytics approach. The analysis focuses on demographic and behavioral factors such as smoking status, BMI category, and age group.

## Business Problem
Healthcare insurance providers face challenges in understanding cost variability across customer segments. Without clear insights, pricing strategies, risk assessment, and preventive care initiatives become inefficient.

## Approach
This project follows a structured analytics workflow:
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, Power Query modeling, and dashboard creation
- **SQL**: Data validation, aggregation, and analytical verification
- **Tableau**: Interactive visual dashboards for executive-level insights
- **Python**: Statistical validation, aggregation checks, and visual confirmation

## Key Insights
- Smokers incur significantly higher healthcare costs than non-smokers
- Obese individuals have higher average medical expenses
- Healthcare costs increase consistently with age, especially after 45+

## Tools Used
Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables), SQL (MySQL), Tableau Public, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Outcome
Delivered a fully validated, end-to-end analytics solution demonstrating strong data engineering, analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills.
